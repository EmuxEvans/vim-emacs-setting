# Emacs
Emacs is the most powerful tool for me.

I love my Emacs very much.

# Vim
I have a long time no using vim.

# Visual Studio
The most powerful IDE in Windows.

# Install of my config
[Dangerous] Just run install.sh, it will link ~/{~/.emacs,~/.emacs.d,~/.vim,~/.vimrc} to the according config.
